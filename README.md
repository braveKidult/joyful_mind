# Joyful Mind

### Joyful Mind is a mindfulness app which is an free extention of my online course at MOOCs platforms and my own educational technologies platform.


This side project contains a backend written in Python Django and a frontend app written in flutter. I create this project only for fun. 

## Backend

Django project inspired by three books:

* Test-Driven Development with Python
* Architecture Pattern with Python
* Designing Data-Intensive Applications: The Big Ideas Behind Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Systems 

## Frontend
